# Higgs Bosons Explained in Simple Terms

Higgs bosons are fundamental particles in physics that are associated with the Higgs field, which is a field that exists throughout the universe. You can think of the Higgs field like a thick syrup that fills all of space. 

When other particles move through this field, they interact with it. Depending on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field, they gain mass. 

Imagine trying to walk through a swimming pool versus walking through air. Walking through water (or the syrup) makes it harder to move and feels heavier than walking through air. This is similar to how the Higgs field gives particles mass. 

The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 confirmed the existence of this field and provided answers to how particles acquire mass, making it a significant landmark in our understanding of the universe.
